Langton's Ant
=============

A short project I whipped up on night, experimenting with a "cellular automaton" called [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant).

Compiles with [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/).

The program outputs a PNG file using the [lodepng](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng) library.
